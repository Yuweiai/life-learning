### Opening a full-scren modal（打开全屏模态弹框）

​	Dictionary.com provides no satisfactory definition of modal as it relates to user interfaces, but semantic UI describe it as follows:

​	A modal displays content that temporarily blocks interactions with the main view

> 由于与用户界面相关，Dictiona.com 并未提供令人满意的模态弹框定义，但就语义而言，用户界面对其描述如下：模态弹框显示的内容会暂时阻止与主视图的交互

​	This sounds about right. A modal is like a popup —— it's not part of your primary navigation flow —— it usually has a different transition, a different way to dismiss it, and is intenden to focus on one particular piece of content or interaction.
